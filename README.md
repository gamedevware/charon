Overview
========
Charon is a powerful game development tool that streamlines the game development process. 
It provides a structured approach to designing and modeling game data, with automatic source code generation that reduces the load on programmers and eliminates human errors. 
Charon also offers support for working with text in multiple languages, with easy loading and unloading of translated text. 

With Charon, game developers can focus on creating engaging gameplay experiences without worrying about the technical details of managing game data. 
It is available in three deployment variants, including a [standalone](https://gamedevware.github.io/charon/standalone/overview.html) application, [web](https://gamedevware.github.io/charon/web/overview.html) application, and [Unity](https://gamedevware.github.io/charon/unity/overview.html) plugin.
