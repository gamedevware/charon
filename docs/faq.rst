Is schema inheritance available?
   Yes, schema inheritance is available in Charon. However, instead of traditional inheritance, Charon adopts a composition-based approach for extending schemas. This means that you can enhance and expand the functionality of existing schemas by including them into another schemas as ``Document`` properties. By leveraging composition, you can create more complex and specialized schemas without the need to modify or redefine the base schema directly.
