Migrating to Web Application
============================

To migrate to the web application, you can do it through a `backup <../web/migrating_to_web>` or through the "Connection" mechanism.  

In short: you need to create an empty project in the web application, click **Connect** in Unity's Inspector window, and specify that you want to upload data to the web application.
